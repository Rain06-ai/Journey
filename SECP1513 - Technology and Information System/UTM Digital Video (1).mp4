I gained a lot of valuable information about my course. The most fascinating part was being able to participate in this program with my group members,
who were incredibly supportive and fun.

Beyond that, I had the chance to visit an interesting booth throughout the event. 
All the speakers shared a wealth of information, such as the development journey of the UTMSmart application and insights into future careers like Data Engineering.
Furthermore, my team and I got the opportunity to interview most of the speakers!
